# Responsive-Portfolio
Homework 2 for Northwestern

This is a basic portfolio website using only HTML5 and CSS. Media queries were used to make this site mobile responsive.
This site has media breakpoints at 980px, 768px, and 640px. 980px is the average windows size of a laptop or desktop screen.
768 px is the average width of a tablet and 640px with is the width of a phone in landscape mode.

In order to increase workflow the Google Chrome extension Window Resizer was used. Window Resizer resizes
the browser window to whatever pixel range you want and it also emulate different screen resolutions.
